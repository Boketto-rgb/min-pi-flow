## ⚙️ How min-pi-flow Works

min-pi-flow is designed to help you visualize the flow matching process. It offers two main components:

- **Teacher Model**: This is a representation of a flow matching model, showing how learning occurs over multiple iterations.
- **Student Model**: This is the minimal Pi-Flow version, which approximates the teacher's performance while using fewer resources.

You can expect the application to handle tasks efficiently while providing visual feedback.

## 🌟 Features

- Simple interface for ease of use.
- Interactive flow matching demonstrations.
- Lightweight application that runs smoothly on most systems.
- Continuous improvements based on user feedback.
